/**
 * This class is used to generate Multicast Address in a range specified by a Base Address and a bound
 * It keeps track of which address are currently in use, so getNewAddress() js never an address already in use
 *
 * Base address is stored as an integer value, so it can easily generate random address by adding a random integer between 0 and bound
 * The integer value is then converted in a String which contains the address in dotted notation
 *
 * This generator only works with IPv4 address, which are 32-bit address
